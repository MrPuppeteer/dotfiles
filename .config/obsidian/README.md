# [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

This directory contain catppuccin mocha flavour theme from [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/obsidian).

## Usage

This theme provides the full range of Catppuccin palettes when
used with the
[Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings#obsidian-style-settings-plugin)
plugin
(see [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins)
for more on using plugins with Obsidian).

This plugin will allow users to pick from several variations on
Catppuccin, including accents for each color in the palette and
one that features the full host of Catppuccin colors (the
default). New options will be exposed through the Style Settings
plugin over time.

### Obsidian theme store

To install from the Obsidian theme store:

Open Obsidian and go to `Preferences` >> `Appearance`,
click `Manage` and scroll down to 'Community Themes.' Type '
Catppuccin' in the filter bar and then click 'Use' under the
theme name.

To use Catppuccin Latte, set the `Base color scheme` option to `Light`.
For one of the three dark themes, set `Base color scheme` to `Dark`.
This defaults to Catppuccin Mocha; install Style Settings as described below to change your dark theme flavor to FrappÃ© or Macchiato.

Choose Catppuccin Mocha btw.
